== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Currently I have not measured or weighed my products. Can I still get rates? =
Royal Mail needs the product weight to calculate the shipping rates.Hence product weight is mandatory.Please add the weight attributes to your products. =

= My rates are coming as multiples of the item quantity. If I keep 2 items in cart, then the rate is getting doubled? Why is that happening?=
